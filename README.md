### Project Motivation

> For this project, I'm interested in answering following questions about Seattle AirBNB Listings.

1) What types of listings are popular?
2) When is the best time of the year to start a marketing campagn?
3) How well can we predict the price of a listing? What aspects correlate well to listing prices?

### Data
The data used for the project is Seattle AirBNB Dataset and it can be downloaded from **Kaggle**:

[Seattle Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)


### File Descriptions

Jupyter Notebook ([seattleairbnb.ipynb](https://github.com/eunbeejang/SeattleAirBNB/blob/main/seattleairbnb.ipynb)) works related to the above questions. 


### Result
- According to my analysis, the popularity of a listing is defined by type and the location of the property. The trend differs by the room_type (ie. entire place, private room, and shared room). For listings with ehtire place, most popular listings were Bed&Breakfast, Cabin, and Camper/RV located in Rainier Valley, Queen Anne, Northgate, and Ballard. For listings with private rooms, Bed&Breakfast, Cabin in Downtown and Queen Anne were popular. For shared units, apartments in University District was the most popular listing type.

- The overall trend shows declining occupancy rates throughout the year 2016. This means that AirBNB renting activity in Seattle is decreasing. However, surge of rental activities are observed between April and August 2016 and there is another spike in renting activities in January 2017, which could be contributed by the end-of-the-year holiday season.
